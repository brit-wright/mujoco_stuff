Keeping some notes about what the docs mean

1. noel_maze_walk_turn_point_6.npz 

Both the max rotation speed and max forward speed are set to 0.6 m/s
Uses tighter constraints in the controller for angular and spatial error and looser turn in place contraints:
- Triggers turn in place when angular error is greater than 0.4 (could be looser since the tracking was already pretty good)
- Triggers goal found when distance within 1e-1 and angle within 4e-1
Stops at each checkpoint, even if the angular error is small - need to fix this
Min velocity threshold set to 0.3 m/s

2. noel_maze_walk_turn_point_8.npz 

Both the max rotation speed and max forward speed are set to 0.8 m/s
Needs tigher constraints for turn in place:
- Triggers turn in place when angular error is greater than 0.2 (needs tightness due to poorer tracking)
- Uses same goal threshold values as 0.8 version
Stops at each checkpoint, even if the angular error is small
Notice that there's some stomping during some of the gait patterns --> my best guess is that this could be due to the changing
'gait length' which is a function of velocity. The difference between 0.8 m/s and the min 0.3 m/s might be enough to make the gait become hobbley

3. noel_maze_walk_turn_1_point_0.npz

Both the max rotation speed and max forward speed are set to 1.0 m/s
Uses same turn in place constraints as noel_maze_walk_turn_point_8.npz
Uses looser constraints for angular and spatial error (due to poorer tracking and faster velocity, the robot can overshoot the goal)
- Triggers goal found when distance within 2e-1 and angle within 5e-1
Stops at each checkpoint, even if the angular error is small
Also noticed some stomping here even though in this script, the minimum forward velocity is set to 0.5 m/s

4. noel_maze_walk_turn_1_point_0_v2.npz

Both the max rotation speed and max forward speed are set to 1.0 m/s
Kept the same turn in place constraint
Slightly loosened the the angular and spatial contraints
- Triggers goal when either 1. ditance within 2e-1 and angle within 6e-1 OR 2. distance withing 1.5e-1 and angle is anything
- Increased the minimum distance to 0.7
- Changed the stabilization distance and noticed improvement in gait. Defined midpoint = 3*(0.7 + 1.0)/4 and used that as the stabilization distance.
- Noticed that at max rotation speed = 1.0 m/s the turning in place would be a bit violent. I enforced hard constraints of +=6, for next iteration
- I want to do a numpy.clip instead of a hard constraint because the hard constraint makes it take longer for the angular error to close.

5. noel_maze_walk_turn_1_point_0_v2.npz

Same contraints as noel_maze_walk_turn_1_point_0_v1.npz.
Applied the np.clip method. Noticed better turning in place (bestie doesn't look like she's on the verge of falling over)
But also noticed a kinda messy transition between turning and forward stabilization
Going to take a break from this for now to focus on removing unnecessary stops in path :D
